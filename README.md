- [Backend Link built with Adonis](#)

##### Why Adonis as backend
- Very similar to the GOAT - LARAVEL
- Better benchmarks since it runs on node (argumentative)
- Really good for deevoping Quick, Scalable Apps
- Opinionated - YES! unlike Express.js
- If adonis didn't exist, then Yes Laravel

##### Why Not Firebase
- Can become expensive when you have a higher traffic with a smaller [ROI](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp)
- Postgre and MySQL is fun - with the option of MongoDB(Adonis)
- Other than that, Firebase remains the KING!

> PRs are welcome for firebase integration. The firebase version will reside over at the `firebase` branch.

## Outro
**DBAD** - Don't Be A D*ck! - This is being offered for free, and it would go a long way 
if you'd support the project. Also, my 2016 MBP's keyboard has started misbehaving. I would very much like one of those new M2s :)
